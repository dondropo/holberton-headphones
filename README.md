# 0x09. Implement a design from scratch

This project consists of the implementation of a design for a web application designed for music consumption.
The main idea is to make a practice, implementing this design from scratch and step by step.
During this project, you will not have many instructions, you are free to implement it the way you want - the goal is simple: To have a fully functional website that looks like the design file.

It is not an easy exercise, but it will be your life in the company/start-up, you will discuss with the designers, implement their work and have them review your implementation.

Building a website the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place solid foundations:
